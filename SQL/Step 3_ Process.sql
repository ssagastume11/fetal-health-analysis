-- Objective:

-- The goal of this step is to transform the cleaned fetal hetal dataset into
-- meaningful analytical summaries that allow for comparison across fetal hetal
-- classifications.
--This includes aggregating CTG features, calculating descriptive statistics,
-- and structuring the data to uncover patterns that distinguish Normal, Suspect, 
-- and Pathological fetal health outcomes

-- Key Actions:

-- * Aggregate CTG indicators by fetal health classication.
-- * Compute summary statistics (e.g., averages, ranges, counts) for key features.
-- * Compare fetal heart rate, variability, accelerations, and decelerations
-- across health categories.
-- * Prepare grouped and summarized tables to support trend analysis,
-- visualization, and interpretation.
-- * Create analysis-level views or tables that highlight differences
-- between low-risk and high-risk fetal health cases.
